      <p> Hello, my name is Brandon Weir and I'm a complete newbie to coding. This is actually the first site that I've created
        and I'm excited to do so much more. The site is static because I've yet to learn Javascript or any back end development,
        but I'll be increasing the functionality as I go along.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p> The reason that I decided to enroll in the Coding Boot Camp and take up this challenge is that I want a new career.
        I want to do work that is creative, dynamic, and engaging, and at this point in the course, I think that I've found
        it. By the end of these 23 weeks, I'll have the skills to be a full stack developer and find a job in the field.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I'll be periodically updating my Portfolio with homework assignments and personal projects that I've worked on, so
        feel free to browse. If you want to drop me a line, you can do so on the Contact page.</p>
